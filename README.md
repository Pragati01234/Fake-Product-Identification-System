# Fake-Product-Identification-System
In the current advancing world of technology, the global development of a product or technology always comes
with risk factor such as counterfeiting and duplication, which can affect the company name, company revenue,
and customer health. The basic idea of the project is to verify that the product purchased by the customer is
fake or real. In comparison with blockchain we have traditional supply chain. Traditional supply chain provides
centralized network where the data is in the hand of the company which provides the service or the products in
the market, and they own the data so they can manipulate as per their wish so they are not secure.
Counterfeiting of the product are produced to take advantage of the superior value of the imitated products. As
mentioned, traditional supply chain provides centralized network whereas Blockchain provides decentralized
data base, every transaction involving the data value for the product. This is done by creating a record whose
authenticity can be verified by the entire community since blockchain runs by peer-to-peer network. In such a
way manufacturer can use this system to provide genuine products to the customer. This will help to maintain
the customer trust and to increase the brand value of the product in the market. In blockchain every block
consists of data, hash and previous block hash. Data contains the relevant information and hash consists of the
unique code. It is impossible to change data of any block since person changing the data requires to own the
majority of the network. If we try to change the data of any block the hash will get changed. So, this becomes the
major advantage over the traditional centralized architecture where the data in blockchain is immutable so that
the customer who buys the product gets the genuine information of the product.
System is maintaining Status of product i.e., Manufacturer of product, current owner of product, and history of
owners, time stamp i.e., at what time product was updated and a QR code.
Stage 1: Product Enrollment Process:
Initially manufacturer will be the first owner of product.
So, manufacturer will request administrator to add product on the network, at that time QR code will be
generated. Administrator will enroll product and manufacturer on the network, and QR code is taken.
Stage 2: Ship Product to Distributor:
In the next step manufacturer will ship the product to distributor. When distributor receives product will scan
the QR code and update his details on the network, about product ownership, time Stamp and date.
Stage 3: Ship Product to Retailer:
At this Stage, the retailer receives product from Distributor and scan QR code assigned to product using QR
code scanner, and will update owner details of the product on the network.
Stage 2: End User Authentication Process:
At the end of the chain, customer will take the product, go to website and upload QR code over there, and
customer will able to get all detail about product from manufacture to last retailer. And after getting details, it
his question where to buy the product or not.
The results of the project show that how the system work. It uses QR code for authenticating the product
originality, if the scan QR code shows the details of the for the product which includes the description, product
name, manufacturer name, company name, unique product id, and others then we can say that product is
authentic.
If by scanning the product QR code if it does not show any details the we can say that the data for the product
does not present in the blockchain system and it has been counterfeited. So, we can say that the product is fake.
